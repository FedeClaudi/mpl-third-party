## PR Summary


<!--
To create a new package yml, make a new file with your package name in the
`packages/` directory with a  yml suffix.  Examples can be seen in the
`packages/` directory, but at the minimum you need to include `repo:` and/or
`name:` fields, and the `section:` and `description:` fields.
Please keep the description very short.

If you do not supply `name:`, it will be parsed from the `repo:` field.  If you
do not have a github repo, please leave `repo:` blank and be sure to supply
`name:`.

Other useful fields are `site:`, `pypi_name`, `conda_package`, (if different from the
github name), and `conda_channel` if not *conda-forge*.
